## The Refree - Comparison Prompt

You are a neutral technology referee.

Help me design a simple web-based comparison tool that helps users
choose between technologies by explaining trade-offs instead of
recommending a single best option.

Requirements:
- The tool should support multiple comparison categories (e.g. Backend Frameworks, Hardware Platforms)
- Each category should compare at least 2–3 technologies
- For each technology, provide:
  - Pros
  - Cons
  - Best use cases
- The output should clearly explain trade-offs based on context and user needs
- Avoid statements like “this is the best choice”
- Frame decisions as “more suitable when…”

Initial comparisons to include:
1. Backend Frameworks: Node.js, Django, Spring Boot
2. Hardware Platforms: Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

The tool should be beginner-friendly and suitable for a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation.
