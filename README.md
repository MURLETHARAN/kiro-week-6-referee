## Kiro Week 6 – The Referee

This project is a technology comparison and decision-support tool – The Referee challenge.

The tool helps users compare multiple technology options and understand trade-offs instead of recommending a single “best” choice. It acts as a neutral referee, presenting pros, cons, and best-fit scenarios so users can make informed decisions based on their project requirements.

The current implementation includes interactive comparisons for:

Backend Frameworks (Node.js, Django, Spring Boot)

Hardware Platforms (Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W)

Users can select a comparison category and view:

Strengths and weaknesses of each option

Typical use cases

Key trade-offs such as simplicity vs capability, power vs performance, and flexibility vs structure

The tool is intentionally simple, beginner-friendly, and extensible, making it easy to add new technology categories or comparison criteria.

Kiro was used throughout the development process to:

Design comparison structures

Identify relevant trade-offs

Generate clear, neutral explanations

Ensure the tool supports decision-making rather than single-answer recommendations
