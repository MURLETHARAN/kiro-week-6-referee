## Kiro Week 6 – The Referee

This project compares Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for beginner
hardware projects.

Instead of recommending a single device, the tool explains trade-offs
based on project requirements such as power consumption, complexity,
and application type.

Kiro was used to generate structured comparisons and decision reasoning,
helping accelerate development and improve clarity.
